# First Responder Information Aid Project
*PLTW Engineering Capstone Project | In Progress, developed planning*

## 💡 Project Vision
This project aims to bridge the information gap for first responders during high-threat crises. By utilizing C# in Unity for Meta Quest Mixed Reality Headsets, the goal is to provide real-time situational awareness to emergency personnel.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Languages**: C# (to be developed in Unity)
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TBD
- **Documentation:** [Project Main Document](file:///Users/cameronjiang/Downloads/Main%20Doc_%20Augmented%20Reality%20Crisis%20Helper%20(ARCH).pdf)

## 🏗️ Core Engineering Challenges
- **Information Overload:** Ensuring solution does not entail information overload for First Responders
- **Real-World Feasiblity:** Physical solution must not obstruct view, be heavy, or fall off user

## 🚀 Future Development
- Develop the code to take in information from threat detection AI models through specialized cameras
- Ensure low latency between cameras and output from Meta Quest Headset
