# First Responder Information Aid Project
*PLTW Engineering Capstone Project | In Progress, Developed Planning*

## 💡 Project Vision
This project aims to bridge the information gap for first responders during high-threat crises. By utilizing C# in Unity for Meta Quest Mixed Reality Headsets, the goal is to provide real-time situational awareness to emergency personnel.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Languages**: C# (to be developed in Unity)
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Unity Enginer and Meta OpenXR SDK
- **Documentation:** [Project Main Document](./AugmentedRealityCrisisHelper_MainDoc.pdf)

## 🏗️ Core Engineering Challenges
- **Heuristic UI/UX Design** — Optimizing the Heads-Up Display (HUD) to provide critical data without compromising the user's cognitive load.
- **Ergonomic Integration & Spatial Awareness** — Ensuring the hardware maintains a clear field of vision (FOV) and utilizes passthrough technology to keep the user grounded in their physical environment.

## 🚀 Future Development
- Develop the code to take in information from threat detection AI models through specialized cameras
- Ensure low latency between cameras and output from Meta Quest Headset
